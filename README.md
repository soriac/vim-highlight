This is a copy of a plugin found in the vim wiki:
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Auto\_highlight\_current\_word\_when\_idle

I just put it on github to learn how vim plugins work with a manager.
Credits to the original author, "mosh".

Highlight all instances of word under cursor, when idle.
Useful when studying strange source code.
Type z/ to toggle highlighting on/off.
